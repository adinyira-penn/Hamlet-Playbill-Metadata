The metadata that I recorded for my playbill was specifically chosen for the following reasons. I used the ID and File Name categories to identify each file and make it clear what section of the playbill I was referring to for the accesser. The description category was chosen to provide an overall assessment of what each page/file contained. The last two categories were Intended Audience and Historical Context and I included them to go further than the description section in terms of truly detailing the playbill and its contents. Overall, I made the choices that I did in order to describe and classify the playbill to the best of my ability using the pieces of content that left the most prominent impressions on me.
